# Custom nonogram app!

This is a web-based game, built around the rules of nonogram puzzles.
This game was built in Expo with React native
It allows you to import a custom photo, which it will turn into the basis of the nonogram puzzle, or a default is supplied.  
For best results it is recommended you use pictures with high contrast! 

Play the game at: https://nonogram-app.vercel.app

## How the game works:
* The board is set up as a 15 x 15 grid, with clues around the outside
* The aim of the game is to fill in each square so it corresponds with the clues on the side and on the top
* If there are two 'runs' of filled squares in the row, the clues will be made of 2 numbers (2, 5 would be a run of two and a run of 5)
* Once every row and column is fulfilled, you win!
